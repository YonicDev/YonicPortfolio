My name is Mario, and I am a young game designer and level designer from Spain.
I graduated from ESNE - Escuela de Diseño, Innovación y Tecnología in 2018, and I love making games with a great focus of world building and exploration!

## My game design philosophy
My works can be described with four words.

### Experience
A good game must be fun to experience. My works try to be as engaging for anyone, regardless of age, likings, and disabilities.

### Exploration
The games I design bring many worlds of different types, from charming to harsh, from minimalistic to ample... But every single one promises big and unique rewarding experiences when exploring them.

In some way or another, players will have a huge room of oportunity for exploring the games and their worlds, all connected in one unique universe, spanning through space and time.

### Inmersion
Many people describe inmersion in games as the "feeling inside the game". In my games, that is not necessarily true. My games also provide other ways of connecting the player in an emotional level, and encourage mimicking other aspects of their lives within the universe of the game.

### Unique
Be it graphical, narrative or musical, my works always strive for being aesthetically unique in some way or another. Some of them do it by wowing the player with an aesthetical beauty, others give a new twist in gameplay, but in the end, their ultimate goal is to provide an experience that a player would never forget.

## Other things I like to make
From time to time, I am always keen to experimenting creating other things, apart from videogames. For example:
* Short animations
* Illustrations
* Music compositions
* Game hacking and modding
* Writing stories and novels
