# Prime VR
Formerly known as *Metroid Prime VR*, it was the project I worked on for my final degree research project: "Adapting gameplay mechanics of an first person shooter videogame to virtual reality platforms". It is a port of the original Metroid Prime for GameCube to Oculus VR and HTC Vive.

Although development was never completed, a demo of the game was showcased in Madrid Games Week 2019 and the research project received honors. In the future, I would like this game to be a basis for a completely new and original videogame.

Many videos involving the development of the port and the research of the original game are available in [YonicStudios' YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbPXx-YdEQ6JPwsOW7bzjtg).

## Revamped gameplay
While most of the gameplay mechanics have been kept mostly the same, some have been completely revamped to enhance the immersion to the max. For the first time in the Metroid series, you can move around with the Morph Ball with an inside view, and change visors and weapons just like Samus Aran would do.

## *Tallon Tour*
*Tallon Tour* is the name given to the demo that was showcased in Madrid Games Week 2019. In the demo, you had 3 minutes to collect all Chozo Artifacts scattered across one of the most emblematic areas in the original game, with a hidden surprise at the end.

We received a lot of positive feedback from fans and many other people who played the demo!
